# act-api-server agent instructions

## Repository restrictions and invariants

- Do not run `git reset`, `git filter-repo`, or `git clean`.
- Do not run `rm` except when explicitly deleting known temporary or scratch files.
- `dotenv` is blacklisted. Do not install or use it; configuration comes from the process environment.
- Preserve graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown, public health/readiness probes, OTLP tracing initialization, and fail-soft NATS integration.
- Do not turn event-bus unavailability into total API unavailability unless the design explicitly requires it and tests cover the behavior.
- Keep Docker images multi-stage, non-root, minimal, and reproducible.

## Instruction discovery

Resolve `$PWD`, walk upward through every parent directory to the filesystem root, read every readable lowercase `agents.md` on that ancestor chain, and apply them root-to-leaf. Do not search siblings. Deduplicate resolved paths/inodes, avoid symlink cycles, and report unreadable files.

## Synchronize with the remote

Before editing, inspect `git status`, current branch, remotes, and default branch. Run `git fetch --all --prune` and create the feature branch from the latest remote default branch. Fetch again before pushing and incorporate upstream changes using repository merge policy.

- avoid git rebase in favor of git merge.
- Never discard remote commits, force-push, rewrite shared history, bypass review, or bypass required CI.

## Resolve Git conflicts semantically

Resolve conflicts by understanding and combining both sides' intent. Do not mechanically choose `ours`, `theirs`, current, or incoming changes. Produce the conceptually correct result while preserving compatible API behavior, event delivery, fail-soft dependencies, graceful shutdown, observability, health probes, container hardening, tests, documentation, configuration, and contracts. If intentions are incompatible, make the smallest explicit design decision and document it in the pull request.

After resolving, reread every affected file from the top, run formatting, linting, tests, builds, and container/security validation, then search the entire worktree for conflict markers:

```sh
grep -RInE '^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)' --exclude-dir=.git .
```

If any marker or suspicious partial resolution remains, repeat semantic resolution from the top and rerun validation. A conflict is resolved only when the result is conceptually coherent and verified, not merely accepted by Git.

## Repository-local Git worktrees

- Create or use a Git worktree only when the human operator explicitly authorizes it for the current task. Concurrency or a dirty checkout is not permission by itself.
- Put every authorized worktree at `<repository-root>/tmp/worktrees/<name>`; from the repository root, use `./tmp/worktrees/<name>`. Never place worktrees beside repositories or organization directories.
- Keep `tmp`, `temp`, `tmp/worktrees`, and `temp/worktrees` ignored in the repository-root `.gitignore`. Do not commit files from those directories.
- Relocate or remove a worktree only when the operator explicitly requests it. Before removal, preserve and publish intended changes, verify its commit is represented on the target branch, and confirm there are no tracked, untracked, ignored-sensitive, or in-use files that must survive. Remove it with `git worktree remove <path>` without `--force`; never delete a worktree directory with `rm`.
